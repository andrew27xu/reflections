When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share contents with others, and want to work on another computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    give more flexibility to control and make more logical sense

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: from one github to another github; 
    clones: from one github (local) to local (another local)
    branches: in local share same origin

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    By compare with the remote branch, it would be easier to figure if local commit is ahead/behind the remote branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Share files or links. Git/Github is easier for programmer

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Want to expriment, or share to someone before making real changes
